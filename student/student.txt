Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are one of the main image recognition and classification paradigms in the domain of artificial neural networks. They are primarily used in the detection of objects, face recognition, and similar areas where CNNs have been especially effective.

A CNN classification pipeline takes an input image, computes and classifies the image into a predefined category (e.g., Dog, Cat, Tiger, Lion). The network receives the input image as a multi-dimensional array of pixel intensities, where dimensionality depends on the resolution of the image. Therefore, an image can be represented as an h x w x d tensor, with h being height, w being width, and d being the number of channels (depth). An example is a 6 x 6 x 3 RGB array (where the third dimension represents the red, green and blue colour channels) of an image versus a 4 x 4 x 1 grayscale array.

Technically, the process of training and assessing a deep-learning CNN requires each input image to be fed through a sequence of convolutional layers using learnable filters (kernels), pooling techniques, fully connected layers, and a final Softmax activation, which produce class probabilities ranging between 0 and 1. The following figure presents the full computation process of a CNN, showing how an input image is converted into a probabilistic label of the desired object.
